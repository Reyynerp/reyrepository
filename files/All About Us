Title: All About Us
Artist: Marta

High school, sunshine
It's just like the perfect time
I feel your eyes on mine
You don't even gotta try

It's like the stars aligned
I'm wrapped up in your smile
Put my heart on the line
Feel like living freestyle

We're both fallin'
And we were all in
Before we even knew where this was going

Yeah we were fools
Running on love
Caffeine, summer breeze we had it all
80s songs on the radio
Dancing like nobody's home

We were going too fast
Bound to crash
Didn't think twice
It was all about us
It was all about us

All about your hand that you put on mine
And all about you just making me shine
It's us against the town
Cause all we know now

We were fools
Running on love
Caffeine, summer breeze we had it all
80s songs on the radio
Dancing like nobody's home

We were going too fast
Bound to crash
Didn't think twice
It was all about us
It was all about us

We were just young, free and crazy
But the world is bigger than our hometown baby
Young, free and crazy we were

We were fools
Running on love
Caffeine summer breeze we had it all
80s songs on the radio
Dancing like nobody's home
We were going too fast
Bound to crash
Didn't think twice
It was all about us
It was all about us
It was all about us
It was all about us
It was all about us
It was all about us
