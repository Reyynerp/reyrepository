Title: Over
Artist: KIDO3008

We lost our way
We lost our light
I know it's time to let you go
Spread your wings and fly

Our love was once a flame that burn so bright
But now it's time to let  it fade into the night
It's not easy to say goodbye

Now the war is over
I hope you get what you want, girl
I want to see you smile again even without me
If we meet again keep smiling
Like the first time we met
Darling, i will never
Never forget you 

Our love was once a flame that burn so bright

I want to see you smile again even without me
If we meet again keep smiling
Like the first time we met
Darling, i will never
Never forget you
