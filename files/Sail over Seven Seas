Title: Sail over Seven Seas
Artist: Gina T.

Day by day, I miss you so
You have to go, my love
Where the ship's so far away
You tell that you will return
Before the autumn comes
Every day, I dream of you

In my dream's a little seagulls (ooh)
Flying through the darkest night
Searching for some teardrops in the winds (ooh)
With the ship of lonely loveless (ooh)
I sail over seven seas
Tryin' to find the captain of my heart

I sail over seven seas
To find to your heart
I sail through the darkest night (ooh)
I sail to your heart

I sail over seven seas
To find to your heart
I sail with the winter night (ooh)
Alone in the dark

I don't fear the stormy night
And I don't feel the cold (don't feel the cold)
All because I miss you so
In the distance, I can see
The island of my home (island of my home)
Oh, I like to be with you

In my dream's a little seagulls
Flying through the darkest night (ooh)
Searching for some teardrops in the winds (ooh)
With the ship of lonely loveless (ooh)
I sail over seven seas
Tryin' to find the captain of my heart

I sail over seven seas
To find to your heart
I sail through the darkest night (ooh)
I sail to your heart

I sail over seven seas
To find to your heart
I sail with the winter night (ooh)
Alone in the dark

I sail over seven seas
To find to your heart
I sail through the darkest night (ooh)
I sail to your heart
